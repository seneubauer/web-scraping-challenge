# web-scraping-challenge

### Goal
The goal of this assignment was to create a dynamic Flask website that displays data scraped from the a variety of other websites. To pull this off, we were to create the script with a Jupyter Notebook then port this script to a Python function. This function would be used to scrape the data and relay it to the Flask application.

### Execution
This task required steps to extract data from websites, transform them into usable formats, then load them into a MongoDB database. Once in the database, the Flask application is able to pull data from the database and display it dynamically with Jinja2.
